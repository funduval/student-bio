    <section id="main-bio">

        <p>I am an actor, voice artist, audiobook producer, product description writer, business role-player, clinical skills simulator at NY Medical College, Turkish-to-English translator of medical case studies and soap opera subtitles, grassroots political organizer and mom. As you can see I am all over the place, and likely a "master of none." I want an unassailable, valuable skill set, and I want to be surrounded by smart people who are risk takers. This is what brought me to web development and the world of tech. I coded in BASIC when I was young, endlessly creating various iterations of "crappy space invader" and making it do stuff. I want to do so much more."</p>
