        <p>Funda Duval Istvan enjoys working in mediums both digital and humanistic, nurturing a lifelong obsession with language, technology, history and world cultures. As a performer, both literally and figuritively, she has produced large-scale theatrical productions as well as solo work, avante-garde "downtown" performance installations and web commercials. Working in the ever-changing landscape of editing and post-production software, she noticed a knack for quick learning and resolving technical problems.</p>

        <p>An early devotee of high school computer science classes and computer languages that shall remain nameless, she is now a fullstack web developer with enough command of Javascript to have been hired as both tutor and teaching assistant by Trilogy Education's Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. Funda is looking forward to leveraging her past experience in a fulltime junior dev position.</p>

        <p>As a sound engineer, she has repeatedly ensured retail-ready quality assurance for digital marketplace venues such as Amazon, iTunes and Audible. As a professional SAG and Equity performer, she also currently works in Business Roleplay for clients such as Microsoft and Barclayâ€™s Bank, consulting with executive coaches about high-level soft skills and communication effectiveness in the organizational matrix of a high-stakes firm.</p>
