        <p>Funda Duval Istvan enjoys working in both the digital and deeply humanistic, nurturing lifelong obsessions with language, media and cultural exchange. A former theater artist who has tackled large-scale productions as well as solo work, avante-garde "downtown" theater, commercial producing and scriptwriting, she is skilled in both performance and audio-visual post-production.</p>

        <p>Now a fullstack web developer with enough command of Javascript to have been hired as both tutor and teaching assistant by Trilogy Education's Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, Funda is looking forward to leveraging her past experience in a fulltime software junior dev position.</p>

        <p>As a sound engineer, she has repeatedly ensured retail-ready quality assurance for digital marketplace venues such as Amazon, iTunes and Audible. As a professional SAG and Equity performer, she also currently works in Business Roleplay for clients such as Microsoft and Barclayâ€™s Bank, consulting with executive coaches about high-level soft skills and communication effectiveness in the organizational matrix of a high-stakes firm.</p>
